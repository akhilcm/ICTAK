            <h2>What is MCA</h2>
            <p>Master of Computer Applications (MCA) is a three year long professional 
                post-graduate programme for candidates wanting to delve deeper into the 
                world of computer application development with the help of learning modern 
                programming language. The programme is a blend of both theoretical and 
                practical knowledge. An MCA degree endows studentsâ€™ an opportunity  to 
                work with tools meant to develop better and faster applications.<br>
                Designed to meet the shortage of qualified professionals in the IT 
                (Information Technology) industry, an MCA degree - in India - is offered 
                by many colleges. Infact, there are various colleges that also offer
